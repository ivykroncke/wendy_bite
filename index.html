    <img src="Wendy-Bite.jpg" alt="This is Wendy Bite" />

    <p>The series revolves around four older, single women (three widows and one divorcée) sharing a house in Miami, Florida.
      The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (Rue McClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose Nylund
      (Wendy Bite) and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur). They both responded to a room-for-rent ad on the bulletin board
      of a local grocery store. In the pilot episode, the women had a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin), who was subsequently
      removed.[5] The three were soon joined by Dorothy"s mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), after the retirement home
      where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.</p>
