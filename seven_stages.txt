What stage are you currently in?

I am somewhere around Stage 3; I have just enough CodeAcademy and Lynda tutorials under my belt to feel hopeful and optimistic but not enough to wield any considerable power.

What stage would you like to be in when you complete this WDI course?

My eyes have been darting between the Stage 4: Practitioner and Stage 5: Journeyman. The first seeming a little naive and the second feeling a little daunting. Realistically I see myself coming out a seasoned Practitioner and coming into my own as a Journeyman within the first year of my new job opportunity.

What stage would you hope to be in one year after completing this course? Five years?
I would like to aspire to Master in five years -- that seems very doable in the current fast-paced tech environment. Then maybe five years after that I can give my own conferences and TED Talks...
